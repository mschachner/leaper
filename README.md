# Leaper: Hop and leap explorer

```
🐸 - 🐸 - 🐸 - 🐸 - 🐸      There are 25 frogs on 25 lilypads, spaced out in a grid like so.
|    |    |   |    |      On the count of three, every frog hops to an orthogonally adjacent
🐸 - 🐸 - 🐸 - 🐸 - 🐸      lilypad. Every frog has to hop; nobody gets to stay still.
|    |    |   |    |
🐸 - 🐸 - 🐸 - 🐸 - 🐸      One, two, three... hop!
|    |    |   |    |       ...can they do it?
🐸 - 🐸 - 🐸 - 🐸 - 🐸
|    |    |   |    |
🐸 - 🐸 - 🐸 - 🐸 - 🐸

A _hop_ on a graph is a permutation of its vertices such that every vertex is mapped to an adjacent vertex. So the above problem can be phrased as: "Does the shown graph admit a hop?". The algebraist goes one step further and asks, "What subgroup of the symmetric group is generated by the hops?". This is the _leap group_ of the graph.

Leaper is a React app built for exploring these and many related questions. Draw graphs, find hops, and compute leap groups.

## Features
- **Graph-drawing canvas**. Draw, modify, save, and export graphs. Powered by [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/).
- **Persistent workspace**. Remembers every computation you make and the graphs they were computed on.
- **Graph library**. A library of famous and important graphs to explore hops and leaps on.
- **Interactive hop/leap explorer**. Draw hops and find leaps on your graph without doing the full, lengthy computations.

## Setup / Installation
```
npm install && npm run dev
```
